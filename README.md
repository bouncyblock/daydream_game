## The GIT history is fucked, there is history dating back to the start of the event but due to tragic misunderstandings of how git works a LOT of the git history was lost.

### ALSO: most of the git history that was actually used is on the master branch due to also not understanding how git works and it not letting us merge. (just check that branch for commits IG)
