The Ultimate Sourdough
This is a rogue-lite precision platformer about making a masterful sourdough with crab.

Adventure through a world of constant peril, always at risk of letting your guard down and becoming the sourdough you swore to create. Even should you die, the upgrades so graciously offered by the sourdough will rest with you well into your next attempt (these upgrades gained by sacrificing crabs).

Will you survive to see the rise of the dough, or fall among the many holes in the process.
